    /// A DependencyGraph can be modeled as a set of dependencies, where a dependency is an ordered 
    /// pair of strings.  Two dependencies (s1,t1) and (s2,t2) are considered equal if and only if 
    /// s1 equals s2 and t1 equals t2.
    /// 
    /// Given a DependencyGraph DG:
    /// 
    ///    (1) If s is a string, the set of all strings t such that the dependency (s,t) is in DG 
    ///    is called the dependents of s, which we will denote as dependents(s).
    ///        
    ///    (2) If t is a string, the set of all strings s such that the dependency (s,t) is in DG 
    ///    is called the dependees of t, which we will denote as dependees(t).
    ///    
    /// The notations dependents(s) and dependees(s) are used in the specification of the methods of this class.
    ///
    /// For example, suppose DG = {("a", "b"), ("a", "c"), ("b", "d"), ("d", "d")}
    ///     dependents("a") = {"b", "c"}
    ///     dependents("b") = {"d"}

    ///     dependents("d") = {"d"}

    ///     dependees("d") = {"b", "d"}
    ///     
    /// All of the methods below require their string parameters to be non-null.  This means that 
    /// the behavior of the method is undefined when a string parameter is null.

    /// IMPORTANT IMPLEMENTATION NOTE
    /// 
    /// The simplest way to describe a DependencyGraph and its methods is as a set of dependencies, 
    /// as discussed above.

    /// However, physically representing a DependencyGraph as, say, a set of ordered pairs will not
    /// yield an acceptably efficient representation.  DO NOT USE SUCH A REPRESENTATION.
    /// 
    /// You'll need to be more clever than that.  Design a representation that is both easy to work
    /// with as well acceptably efficient according to the guidelines in the PS3 writeup. Some of
    /// the test cases with which you will be graded will create massive DependencyGraphs.  If you
    /// build an inefficient DependencyGraph this week, you will be regretting it for the next month.
