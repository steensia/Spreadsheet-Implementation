    /// spreadsheet consists of an infinite number of named cells.
    /// 
    /// A string s is a valid cell name if and only if it consists of one or more letters, 
    /// followed by a non-zero digit, followed by zero or more digits.
    /// 
    /// For example, "A15", "a15", "XY32", and "BC7" are valid cell names.  On the other hand, 
    /// "Z", "X07", and "hello" are not valid cell names.
    /// 
    /// A spreadsheet contains a cell corresponding to every possible cell name.  
    /// In addition to a name, each cell has a contents and a value.  The distinction is
    /// important, and it is important that you understand the distinction and use
    /// the right term when writing code, writing comments, and asking questions.
    /// 
    /// The contents of a cell can be (1) a string, (2) a double, or (3) a Formula.  If the
    /// contents is an empty string, we say that the cell is empty.  (By analogy, the contents
    /// of a cell in Excel is what is displayed on the editing line when the cell is selected.)
    /// 
    /// In an empty spreadsheet, the contents of every cell is the empty string.
    ///  
    /// The value of a cell can be (1) a string, (2) a double, or (3) a FormulaError.  
    /// (By analogy, the value of an Excel cell is what is displayed in that cell's position
    /// in the grid.)
    /// 
    /// If a cell's contents is a string, its value is that string.
    /// 
    /// If a cell's contents is a double, its value is that double.
    /// 
    /// If a cell's contents is a Formula, its value is either a double or a FormulaError.
    /// The value of a Formula, of course, can depend on the values of variables.  The value 
    /// of a Formula variable is the value of the spreadsheet cell it names (if that cell's 
    /// value is a double) or is undefined (otherwise).  If a Formula depends on an undefined
    /// variable or on a division by zero, its value is a FormulaError.  Otherwise, its value
    /// is a double, as specified in Formula.Evaluate.
    /// 
    /// Spreadsheets are never allowed to contain a combination of Formulas that establish
    /// a circular dependency.  A circular dependency exists when a cell depends on itself.
    /// For example, suppose that A1 contains B1*2, B1 contains C1*2, and C1 contains A1*2.
